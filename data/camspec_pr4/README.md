This repo contains the data for the CamSpec PR4_12.6cl likelihood, described in [Rosenberg, Gratton, and Efstathiou (2022), MNRAS, 517, 4620](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/517/3/4620/6717656) ([arxiv:2205.10869](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10869)).
This is a high-ell likelihood using dust-cleaned TT, TE, and EE power spectra computed from the Planck 2020 (PR4 / NPIPE) maps.
The likelihood code is distributed primarily with [Cobaya](https://github.com/CobayaSampler/cobaya).

This data format is for Cobaya. To use, clone into [Your_Cobaya_Data_Directory/data]/planck_NPIPE_CamSpec/
For more information or to request the data format to be used with CosmoMC, please contact the authors.
